   * Create an API key
   * Set it via environment variable or config:
     ```powershell
     # PowerShell
     $env:OPENAI_API_KEY = 'your-key-here'
     
     # CMD
     set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
     
     # Bash
     export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
     ```
   * Or add to `appsettings.json`:
     ```json
     {
       "OpenAI": {
         "ApiKey": "your-key-here"
       }
     }
     ```

## Running the Application

1. **First Time Setup**
   ```powershell
   # Clone the repository (if you haven't already)
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>

   # Restore dependencies
   dotnet restore
   ```

2. **Build & Run**
   ```powershell
   # Build the project
   dotnet build -c Release

   # Run the application
   dotnet run --project InsightGenerator
   ```

3. **Using the Application**
   
   The app will present two options:

   ```
   Select input mode:
   1) Paste description text (e.g., an 'About Us' section)
   2) Enter the service's name
   ```

   * **Option 1: Paste Description**
     - Choose `1`
     - Paste your text (multiple lines allowed)
     - Send a blank line to finish input

   * **Option 2: Service Name**
     - Choose `2`
     - Type the name (e.g., "Spotify", "Slack")
     - Press Enter

4. **Output**
   
   The analysis will be saved to `sample_outputs.md` with sections:

   ```markdown
   # ServiceName ‚Äì Digital Service Analysis
   
   ## üìÖ Brief History
   [Founding details and key milestones]

   ## üë• Target Audience
   - [Primary user segment]
   - [Secondary user segment]

   ## ‚≠ê Core Features
   1. [First key functionality]
   2. [Second key functionality]
   ...

   [Additional sections with insights]
   ```

   Each run appends to the file with a timestamp, allowing you to compare multiple analyses.

## Configuration

The application can be configured via `appsettings.json`:

```json
{
  "OpenAI": {
    "ApiKey": "your-key-here",
    "Model": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "Temperature": 0.2
  },
  "Output": {
    "FilePath": "sample_outputs.md"
  }
}
```

* **Model** ‚Äì Use `gpt-3.5-turbo` for good balance of speed/quality, or `gpt-4` for deeper analysis
* **Temperature** ‚Äì Lower values (0.2) for focused analysis, higher (0.8) for creative insights
* **FilePath** ‚Äì Where to save the markdown output

## Example Usage

1. **Analyzing Spotify:**
   ```powershell
   dotnet run --project InsightGenerator
   # Choose option 2
   # Enter: Spotify
   ```

2. **Analyzing a startup's About page:**
   ```powershell
   dotnet run --project InsightGenerator
   # Choose option 1
   # Paste the About page text
   # Press Enter twice
   ```

## Limitations & Next Steps

* The service relies on OpenAI's model knowledge, which may not include very recent startups
* For service names, accuracy depends on the model's existing knowledge
* Consider adding:
  * Web scraping for richer data gathering
  * Export to other formats (PDF, HTML)
  * Integration with other AI models
